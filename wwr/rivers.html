                <h2>Yampa River Rafting</h2>
                <p>
                    The Yampa River through the Dinosaur National Monument has it all! As the last free-flowing river in the entire Colorado River drainage, 
                    the Yampa is incredibly wild in May and June. The Rocky Mountain spring run off creates big roaring rapids with an average descent of 12-14 feet per mile. 
                    The gradient at Teepee Rapid is an amazing 31 feet per mile!
                    Raft alongside 2000-foot high white canyon walls with black tiger-stripes; hike side canyons to prehistoric rock art and abandoned caves. 
                    The Yampa joins the Green River at Echo Park for a 180-degree swing around beautiful Steamboat Rock, and then continues through the canyons and Split Mountain Gorge.
                    The whitewater is exciting and heart pounding while the slower river sections offer spectacular scenery to quiet the soul. 
                    Ancient American history and geological features fascinate your thirsty mind; and star-studded nights evoke thought and appreciation for our place on Earth.

            <h2>Colorado River Rafting</h2>
            <p>
                The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the entire southwestern United States. 
                Its powerful waters, which start high on the Continental Divide in Colorado, surge down the mountains and through America’s great Southwestern deserts all the way to Mexico.
                The river feeds thousands of communities along the way. 
                Hidden along its path are wonderful steep-walled canyons that were carved by this powerful force of nature over the thousands of years. 
                To experience the Colorado River up close and personal, on a few-day Colorado River rafting trip or a week-long Utah river rafting family vacation, is a lifetime experience not to be missed.
                Beautiful river canyons
                Thrilling whitewater rapids
                Fascinating Native American ruins and petroglyphs
                A variety of trips lengths and styles
                The river’s heart pounding rapids and gentle, soothing flows are just the vehicle for your transport into a world beyond anything familiar. 
                The 2,000-foot-high red rock canyon walls reveal a fresh, amazing view with every twist and turn.
